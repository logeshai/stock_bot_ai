A simple stock trading bot that uses **Deep Q Learning** to buy, sell or hold stocks by itself.

## Requirements

Python 3 and necessary libraries given in requirements.txt 

Install the required libraries using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager.

For pip version 19.1 or above:

## Future Scopes

* Adding scenarios, features and extra actions if needed. 
* To use RNN and make predictions based on stock returns.
* Visualize the actions made by the bot for each stock with trading and returns graph.
* Build a GUI for the bot and deploy it after making it perfect.
